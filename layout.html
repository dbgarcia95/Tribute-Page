    <p>Hermaeus Mora is one of the most powerful Daedric Princes, Lord of Knowledge, Fate, and Destiny, and resides in his personal Oblivion realm of Apocrypha. He is not seen as an inherently good or evil entity, simply the holder of all forbidden and arcane knowledge. Mora is known to aid seekers of knowledge, provided they do his divine bidding. His Champions have historically been granted access to the Oghma Infinium, a powerful book that gives the user extreme heightened abilities in either the Path of Steel, Shadow, or Spirit. Hermaeus Mora has artifacts known as Black Books scattered throughout the world, all of which grant great power and forbidden knowledge. Some are ancient, before recorded history, while others are from the distant future.</p>
